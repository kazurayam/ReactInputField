# Typing a text into a <input> element which is rendered by React.js

This is a small Katalon Studio project for demonstration purpose.
I maked this as a material for the discussion raised at a topic in the Katlaon user forum at

- https://forum.katalon.com/t/serious-recorder-bug-does-not-work-with-react/143083

Here I will present a Katalon Studio project (not Katalon Recorder, browser extention) that target a public URL which provides React apps in action.

I developed a Test Case script in Katalon Studio v9.0.0

- [TC1](./Scripts/TC1/Script1724447592246.groovy)

I ran this. It ran successful. I could see the TC1 could type a text "Hooah" into the `<input>` element rendered by React.js.

## Conclusion

This experiment proves that a Test Case script in Katalon Studio is capable to type arbitrary text into `<input>` element rendered by React.js.
